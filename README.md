This is repository to host my static site [bishal-gautam.github.io](https://bishal-gautam.github.io/) on github pages.

In order to host a static site on github pages, we must create a repository in following format: 

**username.github.io**

Where username = github profile username 

Then, site will be hosted in same url i.e `username.github.io`

More details on github pages can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/).

If you want to change your site url, you have to change your profile username. Which can be done in this way:
1. Go to Settings under your profile picture on the top-left corner of your github profile.
2. Click on Account tab on the right side.
3. Click on Change Username button.

Thanks.
